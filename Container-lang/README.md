# How to run

**Note**: It is not possible to write a recursive fibonacci function in Container-lang

1. Download latest executable interpreter file from the [Container-lang repo](https://github.com/odddollar/Container-lang)
2. Place interpreter file in same directory as ```.cnl``` files
3. Run the command ```container-lang -f [FILE_NAME_TO_RUN] -d``` in that directory
