# Language Benchmark

This repository is a collection of basic benchmarks to test the speed of numerous programming languages. Every language has the same set of easy to run/compile benchmarks that can be downloaded and tested on a user's computer.

## Benchmarks

Each language directory will contain these benchmarks:

- Finding the factors of 2,000,000,000
- Finding the 50th Fibonacci number using a recursive function
- Finding all prime numbers up to 15,000

All benchmarks must use the same basic algorithm/method. E.g. The Go factor benchmark must use the same algorithm as the Python factor benchmark.

Benchmarks must end with a message that says how long the benchmark took to complete.

All language directories must contain a README.md file with instructions on how to compile/run the benchmarks.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to this repo/project, ensure the benchmarks you create follow the above rules and are in a language that hasn't already been submitted. Submit a pull request containing the benchmarks in another language to be added to this.
